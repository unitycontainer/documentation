Designing applications that conform to these patterns can provide numerous benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Decoupling service providers from service consumers</li>\n<li>Runtime as well as design time configuration of services and dependencies</li>\n<li>Ability to substitute one component for another.</li>\n<li>Centralization and abstraction of crosscutting concerns (logging, authentication, caching, and etc).</li>\n<li>Advanced lifetime management of components and services.</li>\n<li>Simplified testability for individual components and sections of the application.</li>\n<li>Simplified overall design, with faster and less error-prone development.</li>\n<li>Improved reusability of components within other applications.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Unity provides a comprehensive dependency injection and interception platform, and is easy to incorporate into your applications. However, it does change the way that you design these applications. The following sections of this topic describe areas where dependency injection is useful:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pluggable Architectures</li>\n<li>Managing Crosscutting Concerns</li>\n<li>Service and Component Location</li>\n<li>Policy Injection through Interception</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"pluggable-architectures\">Pluggable Architectures</h2>\n<p>By designing applications to use a pluggable architecture, developers and users can add and modify the functionality of an application without changing the core code or processes. ASP.NET is an example of a pluggable architecture, where you can add and remove providers for features such as authentication, caching, and session management. Unity also facilitates a pluggable architecture that allows you to substitute the container for one of your own design and add extensions through the container extensions architecture.</p>\n<p>By using dependency injection mechanisms, such as Unity container, developers can map different components that implement a specific interface (such as a provider interface) or that inherit from a specific base class to the appropriate concrete implementations. Developers can then obtain a reference to the appropriate provider component at run time, without having to specify exactly which implementation of the component is required. The following sections of this topic, Managing Crosscutting Concerns and Service and Component Location, show how you can use dependency injection to create instances of a specific class based on a request for a more general class (such as an interface or base class definition).</p>\n<p>In addition, the providers may require instances of other components. For example, a caching provider may need to use the services of a cryptography component or service. When components require the services of other components, you can use dependency injection to automatically instantiate and inject instances of these components into a component, based on either configuration settings in the container or on code within the application.</p>\n<p>For more information about how you can use dependency injection in this way, see Using Injection Attributes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"managing-crosscutting-concerns\">Managing Crosscutting Concerns</h2>\n<p>The features and tasks implemented in applications are often referred to as concerns. The tasks specific to the application are core concerns. The tasks that are common across many parts of the application, and even across different applications, are crosscutting concerns. Most large applications require services such as logging, caching, validation, and authorization, and these are crosscutting concerns.</p>\n<p>The simplest way to centralize these features is to build separate components that implement each of the required features, and then use these components wherever the management of that concern is required—in one or more applications. By using dependency injection mechanisms, such as a Unity container, developers can register components that implement crosscutting concerns and then obtain a reference to the component at run time, without having to specify exactly which implementation of the component is required.</p>\n<p>For example, if you have a component named FileLogger that performs logging tasks, your application can instantiate this component using the new operator, as shown in the following code.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-C#\">FileLogger myLogger = new FileLogger();\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you then want to change the application to use the new component, FastFileLogger, you must change the application code. However, if you have an interface ILogger that all implementations of the logging component uses, you might instead write the code like the following.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-C#\">ILogger myLogger = new FileLogger();\n</code></pre>\n<p>However, this does not solve the problem because you still must find everywhere in the code where you used new() to create an instance of the specific class. Instead, you can use a dependency injection mechanism to map the ILogger interface to a specific concrete instance of the logging component, or even to multiple implementations, so that the application can specify which one it requires. The following code uses Unity to register a mapping for both a default type of logging component and a named type with the ILogger interface. Alternatively, you can specify these mappings using the Unity configuration file.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-C#\">// Create container and register types\nIUnityContainer myContainer = new UnityContainer();\nmyContainer.RegisterType&lt;ILogger, FileLogger&gt;();       // default instance\nmyContainer.RegisterType&lt;ILogger, FastFileLogger&gt;(&quot;FastLogger&quot;);\n</code></pre>\n<p>The application can then obtain a reference to the default logging component using the following code.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-C#\">ILogger myLogger = myContainer.Resolve&lt;ILogger&gt;();\n</code></pre>\n<p>In addition, the application can use a variable (perhaps set in configuration or at run time) to specify a different implementation of the logging component interface as required, as shown in the following code.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-C#\">// Retrieve logger type name from configuration\nString loggerName = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings[&quot;LoggerName&quot;].ToString();\nILogger myLogger = myContainer.Resolve&lt;ILogger&gt;(loggerName);\n</code></pre>\n<p>For more information about registering types, type mappings, and resolving instances, see Resolving Objects.</p>\n<h2 id=\"service-and-component-location\">Service and Component Location</h2>\n<p>Frequently, applications require the use of services or components that are specific to the application; examples are business logic components, data access components, interface components, and process controllers. In some cases, these services may be instance-based, so that each section of the application or each task requires a separate individual instance of the service. However, it is also common for services to be singleton-based, so that every user of the service references the same single instance of the service.</p>\n<p>A service location facility makes it easy for an application to obtain a reference to a service or component, without having to specify where to look for the specific service or whether it is a singleton-based or an instance-based service. By using dependency injection mechanisms, such as the Unity container, developers can register services in the appropriate way and then obtain a reference to the service at run time, without having to specify exactly which implementation of the service is required or what type of instance it actually is.</p>\n<p>For example, if you have a singleton service class named CustomerData that you interact with to read and update information for any customer, your application obtains a reference to this service usually by calling a static GetInstance method of the service (which ensures that it is a singleton and that only one instance can exist), as shown in the following code.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-C#\">CustomerData cData = CustomerData.GetInstance();\n</code></pre>\n<p>Instead, you can use the Unity container to set the CustomerData class type with a specific lifetime that ensures it behaves as a singleton so that every request for the service returns the same instance, as shown in the following code. Alternatively, you could specify these mappings using the Unity configuration file.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-C#\">// Create container and register type as a singleton instance\nIUnityContainer myContainer = new UnityContainer();\nmyContainer.RegisterType&lt;CustomerData&gt;(new ContainerControlledLifetimeManager());\n</code></pre>\n<p>The application can then obtain a reference to the single instance of the CustomerData service using the following code. If the instance does not yet exist, the container creates it.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-C#\">CustomerData cData = myContainer.Resolve&lt;CustomerData&gt;();\n</code></pre>\n<p>In addition, perhaps a new CustomerFile component you decide to use in your application inherits the same base class named CustomerAccessBase as the CustomerData service, but it is not a singleton—instead, it requires that your application instantiate an instance for each customer. In this case, you can specify mapping names when you register one component as a singleton type and one component as an instance type (with the default transient lifetime), and then use the same application code to retrieve the required instance.</p>\n<p>For example, the following code shows how you can register two named mappings for objects that inherit from the same base class, then—at run time—collect a string value from elsewhere in the application configuration that specifies which of the mappings to use. In this case, the value comes from the AppSettings section of the configuration file. If the value with the key CustomerService contains CustomerDataService, the code returns an instance of the CustomerData class. If it contains the value CustomerFileService, the code returns an instance of the CustomerFile class.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-C#\">IUnityContainer myContainer = new UnityContainer();\n// Register CustomerData type as a singleton instance\nmyContainer.RegisterType&lt;CustomerAccessBase, CustomerData&gt;(&quot;CustomerDataService&quot;, \n                        new ContainerControlledLifetimeManager());\n// Register CustomerFile type with the default transient lifetime\nmyContainer.RegisterType&lt;CustomerAccessBase, CustomerFile&gt;(&quot;CustomerFileService&quot;);\n...\nString serviceName = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings[&quot;CustomerService&quot;].ToString();\nCustomerAccessBase cData \n  = (CustomerAccessBase)myContainer.Resolve&lt;CustomerAccessBase&gt;(serviceName);\n</code></pre>\n<p>For more information about registering types, type mappings, and resolving instances, see Resolving Objects. For more information about using lifetime managers to control the creation, lifetime, and disposal of objects, see Understanding Lifetime Managers.</p>\n<h2 id=\"policy-injection-through-interception\">Policy Injection through Interception</h2>\n<p>Unity interception with its built-in policy injection module enables you to effectively capture calls to objects you resolve through the Unity DI container, and apply a policy that adds additional functionality to the target object. Typically, you will use this technique to change the behavior of existing objects, or to implement the management of crosscutting concerns through reusable handlers. You can specify how to match the target object using a wide range of matching rules, and construct a policy pipeline that contains one or more call handlers.</p>\n<p>Calls to the intercepted methods or properties of the target object then pass through the call handlers in the order you add them to the pipeline, and return through them in the reverse order. Your call handlers can access the values in the call, change these values, and control execution of the call. For example, the call handlers might authorize users, validate parameter values, cache the return value, and shortcut execution so that the target method does not actually execute where this is appropriate.</p>\n<p>You can configure Unity for policy injection by using a configuration file at design time, see Configuring Policy Injection Policies, or by using the API at run time, see Registering Policy Injection Components.</p>\n<p>The following example uses the Unity API to demonstrate how you can configure Unity to perform interception on a target object, using a policy that contains a logging handler and a validation handler. Notice that the logging handler is added first, so that it will log calls even if validation fails and the validation handler shortcuts the pipeline instead of calling the method of the target object. You can use the streamlined policy definition API provided by the Unity interception container extension to configure the container at run time or you can specify the same behavior at design time by using a configuration file. For an example using the API, see Registering Policy Injection Components. For a design time example, see Configuration Files for Interception.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-C#\">// Create a container and add the interception extension.\nIUnityContainer myContainer = new UnityContainer();\nmyContainer.AddNewExtension&lt;Interception&gt;();\n\n// Configure the container with a policy named MyPolicy\n// that uses a TypeMatchingRule to match a custom class\n// and adds a logging handler and a validation handler\n// to the handler pipeline. You must specify at least one\n// matching rule or the policy will not be applied.\nmyContainer.Configure&lt;Interception&gt;()\n    .AddPolicy(&quot;MyPolicy&quot;)\n         .AddMatchingRule&lt;TypeMatchingRule&gt;(\n                  new InjectionConstructor(&quot;MyCustomType&quot;))\n         .AddCallHandler(typeof(MyLoggingCallHandler))\n         .AddCallHandler(typeof(MyValidationCallHandler));\n\n// Configure the container to intercept calls to the\n// custom class using a TransparentProxyInterceptor.\nmyContainer.RegisterType&lt;MyCustomType&gt;(&quot;myType&quot;,\n    new Interceptor&lt;TransparentProxyInterceptor&gt;(),\n    new InterceptionBehavior&lt;PolicyInjectionBehavior&gt;());\n\n\n// Resolve the custom type through the container when\n// you are ready to use it. When you call a method or\n// set a property on it, the call will pass through\n// the logging handler and the validation handler.\nMyCustomType myNewInstance = myContainer.Resolve&lt;MyCustomType&gt;(&quot;myType&quot;);\n</code></pre>\n<p>For more information about interception and policy injection, see Using Interception and Policy Injection.</p>\n","content_git_url":"https://github.com/unitycontainer/documentation/blob/develop/articles/application.md","depot_name":".","document_id":"2f0a617d-9eaf-6117-88ac-584be21485aa","document_version_independent_id":"c37f1880-64cb-c594-2a5c-a9c15ec1b0e8","gitcommit":"https://github.com/unitycontainer/documentation/blob/a08c5cd38778dbc7606660e730b63c1a6800daf1/articles/application.md","is_dynamic_rendering":true,"locale":"en-us","original_content_git_url":"https://github.com/unitycontainer/documentation/blob/develop/articles/application.md","original_content_git_url_template":"{repo}/blob/{branch}/articles/application.md","rawTitle":"<h1 id=\"application-design-concepts-with-unity\">Application Design Concepts with Unity</h1>","search.ms_docsetname":"","search.ms_product":"","search.ms_sitename":"Docs","site_name":"Docs","title":"Application Design Concepts with Unity","uid":"Article.Application.Design","updated_at":"2019-03-04 02:14 AM","wordCount":1920},{"url":"/articles/changelog/","path":"articles/changelog/index.html","source_path":"articles/changelog.md","locale":"en-us","canonical_url":"https:///en-us/articles/changelog/","conceptual":"\n<p>This document contains a list of breaking changes and noteworthy issues.

Theoretically it should be able to recognize these types and properly resolve them individually and in combination. Unfortunately it did not do so. For example if you registered several interfaces like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-C#\">RegisterType&lt;IService, Service&gt;(&quot;1&quot;);\nRegisterType&lt;IService, Service&gt;(&quot;2&quot;);\nRegisterType&lt;IService, Service&gt;(&quot;3&quot;);\nRegisterType&lt;IService, Service&gt;();\n</code></pre>\n<p>resolving enumerable in combination with generic will resolve incorrectly:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-C#\">Resolve&lt;Lazy&lt;IEnumenrable&lt;type&gt;&gt;&gt;  - resolve correctly\nResolve&lt;IEnumenrable&lt;Lazy&lt;type&gt;&gt;&gt;  - resolve empty\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"the-fix-1\">The Fix</h3>\n<p>Release v5.8.0 fixes resolution of collections of generic and array types and Lazy collections of items. This will now work fine:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-C#\">Resolve&lt;Lazy&lt;IEnumenrable&lt;type&gt;&gt;&gt;\nResolve&lt;IEnumenrable&lt;Lazy&lt;type&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\nResolve&lt;Lazy&lt;type[]&gt;&gt;\nResolve&lt;Lazy&lt;type&gt;[]&gt;\n\nResolve&lt;IEnumerable&lt;Lazy&lt;Func&lt;IService&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;()\nResolve&lt;IEnumerable&lt;Func&lt;Lazy&lt;IService&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;()\n\nResolve&lt;Lazy&lt;Func&lt;IService&gt;&gt;[]&gt;()\nResolve&lt;Func&lt;Lazy&lt;IService&gt;&gt;[]&gt;()\n</code></pre>\n<p>The logic behind resolving collections is to find type to enumerate and get all registrations for it no matter how deep in generics tree. Enumerated type could be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Non generic (Constructed Generic) type</li>\n<li>Explicitly registered type</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, in this example</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-C#\">RegisterType&lt;IService, Service&gt;(&quot;1&quot;);\nRegisterType&lt;IService, Service&gt;(&quot;2&quot;);\nRegisterType&lt;IService, Service&gt;(&quot;3&quot;);\nRegisterType&lt;IService, Service&gt;();\n\nResolve&lt;IEnumerable&lt;Func&lt;Lazy&lt;IService&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;();\n</code></pre>\n<p>Unity will recognize <code>IService</code> as registered type and enumerate four instances of <code>Func&lt;Lazy&lt;IService&gt;&gt;</code>.</p>\n<p>But if you look at this example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-C#\">RegisterType&lt;IService, Service&gt;(&quot;1&quot;);\nRegisterType&lt;IService, Service&gt;(&quot;2&quot;);\nRegisterType&lt;IService, Service&gt;(&quot;3&quot;);\nRegisterType&lt;IService, Service&gt;();\n\nRegisterType(typeof(IFoo&lt;&gt;), typeof(Foo&lt;&gt;));  &lt;-- note this registraton\n\nResolve&lt;IEnumerable&lt;IFoo&lt;IService&gt;&gt;&gt;();\n</code></pre>\n<p>Returned result is different! Adding registration for IFoo changes enumerable type to IFoo. This resolution will only return one item.</p>\n<h3 id=\"breaking-change-1\">Breaking change</h3>\n<p>Sometimes you do want Unity to ignore a generic when it resolves collections similar to how it deals with <code>Lazy</code> and <code>Func</code>. Suppose in example above you want Unity to resolve all four of IService instances wrapped in <code>IFoo</code>.\nTo do so you would have to make <code>IFoo&lt;&gt;</code> a <strong>Built-In</strong> type of the container.</p>\n<p>It could be simply done by creating either <a href=\"https://github.com/unitycontainer/examples/blob/master/src/Extending%20Unity/BuildPlanCreator/FooBuildPlanCreatorPolicy.cs\" data-linktype=\"external\">IBuildPlanCreatorPolicy</a> or <a href=\"https://github.com/unitycontainer/examples/blob/master/src/Extending%20Unity/BuildPlan/FooBuildPlanPolicy.cs\" data-linktype=\"external\">IBuildPlanPolicy</a> factories.\nThere are just a few steps you need to follow:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create factory for the generic (See example for <a href=\"https://github.com/unitycontainer/examples/blob/master/src/Extending%20Unity/BuildPlanCreator/FooBuildPlanCreatorPolicy.cs\" data-linktype=\"external\">IBuildPlanCreatorPolicy</a> or <a href=\"https://github.com/unitycontainer/examples/blob/master/src/Extending%20Unity/BuildPlan/FooBuildPlanPolicy.cs\" data-linktype=\"external\">IBuildPlanPolicy</a> )</li>\n<li>Create and extension to get access to Unity internal policies and register your factory (See example <a href=\"https://github.com/unitycontainer/examples/blob/master/src/Extending%20Unity/BuildPlanCreator/FooUnityExtension.cs\" data-linktype=\"external\">IBuildPlanCreatorPolicy</a> or  <a href=\"https://github.com/unitycontainer/examples/blob/master/src/Extending%20Unity/BuildPlan/FooUnityExtension.cs\" data-linktype=\"external\">IBuildPlanPolicy</a>)</li>\n<li>Register your extension with <code>UnityContainer</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>For examples of how it should be done please follow <a href=\"https://github.com/unitycontainer/examples/tree/master/src/Extending%20Unity\" data-linktype=\"external\">this link</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"upgrading-to-unity-521\">Upgrading to Unity 5.2.1</h2>\n<p>This release fundamentally changes how types are registered with Unity. The rationale behind this change is <a href=\"https://github.com/unitycontainer/container/issues/35\" data-linktype=\"external\">this issue</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-problem\">The problem</h3>\n<p>To explain the problem please look at this example. Prior to this release registering singleton <code>ILogger</code> service like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-C#\">container.RegisterType&lt;ILogger, MockLogger&gt;(new ContainerControlledLifetimeManager(), new InjectionConstructor());\n</code></pre>\n<p>would create two registrations:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A mapping between <code>ILogger</code> to <code>MockLogger</code></li>\n<li>A singleton registration for <code>MockLogger</code> with default constructor.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Calling <code>container.Resolve&lt;ILogger&gt;()</code> resolves singleton instance of <strong>MockLogger</strong> as expected, and resolving type <strong>MockLogger</strong> <code>container.Resolve&lt;MockLogger&gt;()</code> would resolve <strong>the same</strong> instance of <strong>MockLogger</strong>. Both <strong>ContainerControlledLifetimeManager</strong> and <strong>InjectionConstructor</strong> would be associated with <strong>MockLogger</strong> registration.</p>\n<p>Suppose you want to resolve a new <strong>MockLogger</strong> whenever it is resolved directly like this  <code>container.Resolve&lt;MockLogger&gt;()</code>. To do so you would create another registration just for the <strong>MockLogger</strong>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-C#\">container.RegisterType&lt;MockLogger&gt;(new TransientLifetimeManager());\n</code></pre>\n<p>So, now when you call <code>container.Resolve&lt;MockLogger&gt;()</code> it resolves new instance of the <strong>MockLogger</strong> class and uses constructor with longest list of parameters. All is well and as expected. But now if you try to resolve <code>container.Resolve&lt;ILogger&gt;()</code> it is no longer returns singleton instance of the <strong>MockLogger</strong>. Now it also returns new <strong>MockLogger</strong> created with constructor with longest list of parameters.\nThe subsequent registration overwritten all information associated with <code>ILogger</code>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-solution\">The solution</h3>\n<p>Release 5.2.1 fixes this behavior. Now all information passed to Unity during registration is stored with <code>FromType</code> instead of <code>ToType</code>. So registering type like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-C#\">container.RegisterType&lt;ILogger, MockLogger&gt;(new ContainerControlledLifetimeManager(), new InjectionConstructor());\n</code></pre>\n<p>creates just one registration <code>ILogger</code> and associates <strong>LifetimeManager</strong> and all provided <strong>InjectionMemebers</strong> with it. At this point  <strong>MockLogger</strong> is still unregistered.</p>\n<p>So, think about it as a <code>RegisteredType</code> and <code>MappedTo</code> type. If you look at initial example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-C#\">container.RegisterType&lt;ILogger, MockLogger&gt;(new ContainerControlledLifetimeManager());\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>ILogger</code> - is a registered type and ContainerControlledLifetimeManager is associated with this type, as well as any <code>InjectionMembers</code> you provide during registration.</p>\n<h3 id=\"breaking-changes\">Breaking changes</h3>\n<p>This release breaks a lot of registrations. Anything relaying on TypeTo being registered in mappings will fail. For example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-C#\">container.RegisterType&lt;ILogger, MockLogger&gt;(new ContainerControlledLifetimeManager());\n\nAssert.AreSame( container.Resolve&lt;ILogger&gt;(), container.Resolve&lt;MockLogger&gt;()) &lt;-- Will fail now\n</code></pre>\n<p>This could be easily fixed by slightly modifying how types are registered. If you want TypeTo to be available independently you could register it like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-C#\">container.RegisterType&lt;MockLogger&gt;(new ContainerControlledLifetimeManager());\ncontainer.RegisterType&lt;ILogger, MockLogger&gt;();\n\nAssert.AreSame( container.Resolve&lt;ILogger&gt;(), container.Resolve&lt;MockLogger&gt;()) &lt;-- Passes\n</code></pre>\n<p>This applies to anything you registering with the type: factories, injection members, interceptors, etc.</p>\n<h3 id=\"fixing\">Fixing</h3>\n<p>With some creative searching and sorting these breaking registrations could be identified statically, without running the code. The key is to look for registrations with same TypeTo type. If you see multiple registrations registering same type as implementation type and at least one of them has non transient lifetime it is a good indicator that it might fail after update:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-C#\">container.RegisterType&lt;ILogger, Logger&gt;(new ContainerControlledLifetimeManager());\n...\ncontainer.RegisterType&lt;IOtherLogger, Logger&gt;();\n</code></pre>\n<p>To fix just add individual registration for implementation type with proper lifetime manager like so:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-C#\">container.RegisterType&lt;Logger&gt;(new ContainerControlledLifetimeManager());\n...\ncontainer.RegisterType&lt;ILogger, Logger&gt;();\n...\ncontainer.RegisterType&lt;IOtherLogger, Logger&gt;();\n</code></pre>\n<p>Make sure it is registered before other mappings.</p>\n<h2 id=\"upgrading-to-unityabstractions-414\">Upgrading to Unity.Abstractions 4.1.4</h2>\n<p>Lifetime managers now support the value <code>null</code>. <code>GetValue</code> must return <code>LifetimeManager.NoValue</code> to indicate that no value has been set. You must upgrade custom lifetime managers to not return <code>null</code> inappropriately. Mainly the <code>GetValue</code> method must be adjusted. The built-in lifetime managers have been upgraded. If you do not use custom lifetime managers you should not see any changes in behavior. (<a href=\"https://github.com/unitycontainer/abstractions/issues/102\" data-linktype=\"external\">https://github.com/unitycontainer/abstractions/issues/102</a>)</p>\n<p>Design time validation for <code>LifetimeManager</code> was added. The marker interfaces <code>ITypeLifetimeManager</code>, <code>IInstanceLifetimeManager</code> and <code>IFactoryLifetimeManager</code> have been introduced. Various other parts of the framework now refer to these types instead of <code>LifetimeManager</code>. The marker interfaces are empty and <code>LifetimeManager</code> does not inherit from any of them. This can lead to compiler errors. In general these errors can be fixed through  changing the type of variables or through casting.

is designed to support a range of common scenarios for resolving instances of objects that, themselves, depend on other objects or services. However, you must first prepare your application to use Unity. The following procedure describes how to include the necessary assemblies and elements in your code.</p>\n<h2 id=\"to-prepare-your-application\">To prepare your application</h2>\n<p>Before you can add Unity to your solution you need to decide if you want to reference packages individually (<a href=\"https://www.nuget.org/packages/Unity.Abstractions/\" data-linktype=\"external\">Abstractions</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nuget.org/packages/Unity.Container/\" data-linktype=\"external\">Container</a>) or use composite <a href=\"https://www.nuget.org/packages/Unity\" data-linktype=\"external\">Unity</a> package.</p>\n<h3 id=\"referencing-composite-package\">Referencing composite package</h3>\n<p>Referencing single <a href=\"https://www.nuget.org/packages/Unity/\" data-linktype=\"external\">Unity</a> package is more appropriate in case of small(ish) project, when everything is contained within one solution. Upgrading such solution is trivial with the help of NuGet Manager.</p>\n<h3 id=\"referencing-individual-packages\">Referencing individual packages</h3>\n<p>Main benefit of referencing <a href=\"https://www.nuget.org/packages/Unity.Abstractions/\" data-linktype=\"external\">Abstractions</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nuget.org/packages/Unity.Container/\" data-linktype=\"external\">Container</a> packages individually is when it is used in large project spanning multiple solutions, modules, and project files.</p>\n<p>Normally modular systems have one main application/module with boot-loader responsible for initializing environment, and number of modules loaded by it (<a href=\"https://prismlibrary.github.io/\" data-linktype=\"external\">Prism library</a> for example). This boot loader is required to reference both <a href=\"https://www.nuget.org/packages/Unity.Abstractions/\" data-linktype=\"external\">Abstractions</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nuget.org/packages/Unity.Container/\" data-linktype=\"external\">Container</a> packages.</p>\n<p>In such systems modules are created and distributed by various teams and departments and synchronization between these might be a challenge.

During object instantiation Unity can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Select appropriate constructor</li>\n<li>Inject constructor with parameters</li>\n<li>Inject public properties with values</li>\n<li>Inject public fields with values</li>\n<li>Call any public method on the created object</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"registering-types-and-object-instances\">Registering Types and Object Instances</h3>\n<p>Unity can resolve any concrete, constructable reference type without registration. For example calling <code>container.Resolve&lt;object&gt;()</code> will produce an instance immediately.</p>\n<p>Registrations allow mapping between service types and implementation types. Create a blueprint of how instances instantiated, initialized, and managed. For generic types it creates internal mini factories that used to generate concrete types. Unity supports three ways of registering types:</p>\n<h4 id=\"instance-registration\">Instance registration</h4>\n<p>Unity exposes a method named <a href=\"xref:Unity.IUnityContainer#Unity_IUnityContainer_RegisterInstance_System_Type_System_String_System_Object_Unity_Lifetime_IInstanceLifetimeManager_\" data-linktype=\"external\">RegisterInstance</a> that you can use to register existing instances with the container. The instance could be registered as concrete type, a type of the instance you would get by calling <code>instance.GetType()</code>, or it could be registered as any of the interfaces the instance implements. Lifetime of registered instance could be either controlled by container it is registered with or externally, in which case Unity just keeps weak reference to the object.</p>\n<h4 id=\"factory-registration\">Factory registration</h4>\n<p>Method <a href=\"xref:Unity.IUnityContainer#Unity_IUnityContainer_RegisterFactory_System_Type_System_String_System_Func_Unity_IUnityContainer_System_Type_System_String_System_Object__Unity_Lifetime_IFactoryLifetimeManager_\" data-linktype=\"external\">RegisterFactory</a> provides a way to register a factory delegate Unity would call when required to provide the type.</p>\n<h4 id=\"type-registration\">Type registration</h4>\n<p><a href=\"xref:Unity.IUnityContainer#Unity_IUnityContainer_RegisterType_System_Type_System_Type_System_String_Unity_Lifetime_ITypeLifetimeManager_Unity_Injection_InjectionMember___\" data-linktype=\"external\">RegisterType</a> is a method where you can instruct Unity how to create and initialize objects from scratch. You can specify:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Constructor to call</li>\n<li>Parameters to pass to the constructor or how to resolve them</li>\n<li>Properties to initialize and how to do it</li>\n<li>Fields to inject and with what</li>\n<li>Methods to call on the created object and parameters to pass to these methods</li>\n<li>Specify how lifetime should be managed</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"managing-the-lifetime-of-objects\">Managing the Lifetime of Objects</h2>\n<p>Unity allows you to choose the lifetime of the objects it creates. By default, Unity creates a new instance of a type each time you resolve that type. However, you can use different lifetime managers to specify a required lifetime for resolved instances. For example, you can specify that Unity should maintain only a single instance (a singleton). It will create a new instance only if there is no existing instance. If there is an existing instance, it will return a reference to this instead. There are also other lifetime managers you can use.</p>\n<h2 id=\"specifying-values-for-injection\">Specifying Values for Injection</h2>\n<p>Unity allows configurations where dependencies are resolved from the container. But it also provides an easy way to configure injection of values at registration. In other words you could provide values for dependencies to be registered and used during subsequent resolutions.</p>\n<p>Unity also allows overriding of any dependency values during resolution. It could override any configured or resolved value during resolution of the type.</p>\n<h2 id=\"populating-collections\">Populating collections</h2>\n<p>Unity has built-in support for resolving arrays and enumerations of types. For example it would recognize following types as collections and resolve them using proper algorithm:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>Resolve&lt;T[]&gt;()</code></li>\n<li><code>Resolve&lt;IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;&gt;()</code></li>\n<li><code>Resolve&lt;List&lt;T&gt;&gt;()</code></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"support-for-deferred-resolution\">Support for deferred resolution</h2>\n<p>Unity container implements strategies to allow deferred resolution of types. It has two types of deferred resolvers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>Func&lt;T&gt;</code> - Creates factory method which instantiates type <strong>T</strong> on demand.</li>\n<li><code>Lazy&lt;T&gt;</code> - Creates <code>Lazy&lt;T&gt;</code> object and passes it to created type.</li>\n</ul>\n","content_git_url":"https://github.com/unitycontainer/documentation/blob/develop/articles/introduction.md","depot_name":".","document_id":"edb43f99-5118-5174-37b2-f733fa1abf87","document_version_independent_id":"e3b1d344-8371-7dbc-ed8d-707d380a75d4","gitcommit":"https://github.com/unitycontainer/documentation/blob/6a49e6e6bf793ca22cb92d5313c37eea597c589a/articles/introduction.md","is_dynamic_rendering":true,"locale":"en-us","original_content_git_url":"https://github.com/unitycontainer/documentation/blob/develop/articles/introduction.md","original_content_git_url_template":"{repo}/blob/{branch}/articles/introduction.md","rawTitle":"<h1 id=\"unity-container-introduction\">Unity Container Introduction</h1>","search.ms_docsetname":"","search.ms_product":"","search.ms_sitename":"Docs","site_name":"Docs","title":"Unity Container Introduction","uid":"Article.Unity.Introduction","updated_at":"2019-11-25 08:32 PM","wordCount":664},{"url":"/articles/quickstart/","path":"articles/quickstart/index.html","source_path":"articles/quickstart.md","locale":"en-us","canonical_url":"https:///en-us/articles/quickstart/","conceptual":"\n<p>This topic describes how to develop applications using Unity, and how to create and build instances of objects. It assumes that you familiar with dependency injection and separation of concerns concepts.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-container\">The Container</h2>\n<p>Unity exposes very compact API to operate the container. The most operations related to registration, resolution, and lifetime management is exposed through one interface - <strong><a href=\"xref:Unity.IUnityContainer\" data-linktype=\"external\">IUnityContainer</a></strong>.</p>\n<p>To start using Unity you need to create an instance of the container and get reference to <a href=\"xref:Unity.IUnityContainer\" data-linktype=\"external\">IUnityContainer</a> interface:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-cs\">IUnityContainer container = new UnityContainer();\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"creating-instances\">Creating instances</h2>\n<p>Once container is created you could start using it immediately:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-cs\">IUnityContainer container = new UnityContainer();\nvar value = container.Resolve&lt;object&gt;();\n\n// Calling Resolve&lt;object&gt;() is the same as \nvalue = new object(); \n</code></pre>\n<p>It will create any type with accessible constructor. Consider following example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-cs\">// Simple class Foo\npublic class Foo\n{\n    public Foo() { }\n\n    public Foo(object obj) { }\n\n    public Foo(string id, object obj) { }\n}\n\n// Create container\nIUnityContainer container = new UnityContainer();\n\n// Resolve Foo\nvar value = container.Resolve&lt;Foo&gt;();\n\n// value created with constructor 'Foo(object obj)'\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>Foo</code> is a simple class with three public constructors. When <code>Resolve&lt;Foo&gt;()</code> is called, Unity will evaluate available constructors and select one with longest list of parameters it can satisfy with dependencies. It will create all required dependencies and pass them to selected constructor during initialization.</p>\n<p>In this particular case Unity will select second constructor with parameter <code>obj</code> of type <a href=\"xref:System.Object\" data-linktype=\"external\">Object</a>. Although constructor <code>Foo(string id, object obj)</code> is longer, it has parameter of type <a href=\"xref:System.String\" data-linktype=\"external\">String</a> which is a primitive type. Unity can not create primitive types by itself. If you want to make these available for dependency injection you would need to register them with the container. For Unity to select third constructor <code>Foo(string id, object obj)</code> you need to register string instance with container:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-cs\">// Register string instance\ncontainer.RegisterInstance(&quot;xyz&quot;);\n\n// Resolve Foo\nvar value = container.Resolve&lt;Foo&gt;();\n\n// value created with constructor 'Foo(string id, object obj)'\n</code></pre>\n<p>For more information on how Unity selects members see <a href=\"../../tutorials/composition/selection/selection/\" data-linktype=\"relative-path\">Member Selection</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"type-mapping\">Type Mapping</h2>\n<p>In service oriented architecture contracts are represented by interfaces and components implement these contracts to provide services. Consider these types:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-cs\">// Public service contract\npublic interface IService \n{\n    // Service API\n}\n\n\n// Component implementing the contract\npublic class Component : IService\n{\n    // Some logic here\n}\n\n\n// Service consumer\npublic class Foo\n{\n    public Foo(IService service)\n    {\n        // Some logic here\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>In this example we have <code>IService</code> interface defining an API and class <code>Component</code> implementing that API. Type <code>Foo</code> is a consumer of the service and should be injected by container with an instance of the service during initialization.</p>\n<p>If you just call <code>container.Resolve&lt;IService&gt;()</code> it will throw an exception complaining that it can not create an interface of type <code>IService</code>. You need to register a <a href=\"../../tutorials/composition/mapping/mapping/\" data-linktype=\"relative-path\">Type Mapping</a> to instructs Unity how to create service of type <code>IService</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-cs\">// Register mapping between IService and Component\ncontainer.RegisterType&lt;IService, Component&gt;();\n\n// Resolve Foo\nvar value = container.Resolve&lt;Foo&gt;();\n\n// value created with constructor 'Foo(IService service)'\n</code></pre>\n<p>During the resolution, when Unity will try to satisfy dependencies, it will look for a registration for each dependency and will find this mapping. It will create <code>Component</code> and passes it to constructor of <code>Foo</code> as <code>IService</code>.</p>\n<p>For more information see <a href=\"../../tutorials/composition/mapping/mapping/\" data-linktype=\"relative-path\">Type Mapping</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"lifetime\">Lifetime</h2>\n<p>By default Unity creates a new instance every time type is requested. Instances it created are not tracked or managed by the container.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-cs\">// Register mapping between IService and Component\ncontainer.RegisterType&lt;IService, Component&gt;();\n\n// Resolve IService\nvar value1 = container.Resolve&lt;IService&gt;();\nvar value2 = container.Resolve&lt;IService&gt;();\n\n// value1 and value2 are not the same\n</code></pre>\n<p>To enable lifetime management, type needs to be registered with one of the compatible <a href=\"xref:Unity.Lifetime\" data-linktype=\"external\">lifetime managers</a>. Depending on registration type Unity provides three helpers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"xref:Unity.TypeLifetime\" data-linktype=\"external\">TypeLifetime</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"xref:Unity.InstanceLifetime\" data-linktype=\"external\">InstanceLifetime</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"xref:Unity.FactoryLifetime\" data-linktype=\"external\">FactoryLifetime</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>For example, to make <code>IService</code> a singleton for the entire application and create it only once you would register it like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-cs\">// Register mapping between IService and Component\ncontainer.RegisterType&lt;IService, Component&gt;(TypeLifetime.Singleton);\n\n// Resolve IService\nvar value1 = container.Resolve&lt;IService&gt;();\nvar value2 = container.Resolve&lt;IService&gt;();\n\n// value1 and value2 are the same instance of Component\n</code></pre>\n<p>For more information see <a href=\"../../tutorials/lifetime/lifetime/\" data-linktype=\"relative-path\">Lifetime Management</a></p>\n","content_git_url":"https://github.com/unitycontainer/documentation/blob/develop/articles/quickstart.md","depot_name":".","document_id":"1eb2a883-aa19-c5b5-593b-d6b67c1546f6","document_version_independent_id":"3c85a775-179c-fd58-72d6-437a7041a3f0","gitcommit":"https://github.com/unitycontainer/documentation/blob/ba6c8d58ec404ad0451d4a77b857483b11fc2a78/articles/quickstart.md","is_dynamic_rendering":true,"locale":"en-us","original_content_git_url":"https://github.com/unitycontainer/documentation/blob/develop/articles/quickstart.md","original_content_git_url_template":"{repo}/blob/{branch}/articles/quickstart.md","rawTitle":"<h1 id=\"using-unity-in-applications\">Using Unity in Applications</h1>","search.ms_docsetname":"","search.ms_product":"","search.ms_sitename":"Docs","site_name":"Docs","title":"Using Unity in Applications","uid":"Article.Unity.Using","updated_at":"2019-04-30 01:18 AM","wordCount":674},{"url":"/articles/toc.json","path":"articles/toc.json","source_path":"articles/toc.yml","locale":"en-us"},{"url":"/","path":"index.html","source_path":"index.md","locale":"en-us","canonical_url":"https:///en-us/","conceptual":"\n<h2 id=\"overview\">Overview</h2>\n<p>The Unity Container (Unity) is a lightweight, extensible dependency injection container.

of the most useful and powerful techniques when using Unity is to take advantage of dependency injection for the parameters of class constructors and methods, and for the values of fields and properties. This approach allows you to resolve and populate the entire hierarchy of objects used in your application based on type registrations and mappings defined in the container, with the subsequent advantages this offers.</p>\n<p>You can specify constructor, field, property, and method call injection information in configuration or by adding registrations to the container at run time. You can also apply attributes to members of your classes to indicate injection targets. When you resolve these classes through the container, Unity will generate instances of the dependent objects and wire up the injection targets with these instances.</p>\n<h2 id=\"using-injection-attributes\">Using Injection Attributes</h2>\n<p>Normally, Unity performs selection of the constructor automatically by choosing the most complex constructor it can satisfy with dependencies and populating these parameters with resolved values when it constructs the object. In some cases, for various reasons, the constructor could not be selected successfully and container may throw an exception.</p>\n<h3 id=\"constructor-annotation\">Constructor Annotation</h3>\n<p>To disambiguate selection or to override automatic behavior you could specify which constructor Unity should use to construct the object by marking it with <a href=\"xref:Unity.InjectionConstructorAttribute\" data-linktype=\"external\">InjectionConstructor</a> attribute.</p>\n<h3 id=\"member-annotation\">Member Annotation</h3>\n<p>Property, field, and method call injections do not occur automatically unless registered with appropriate injection members at run time.

You wish to defer resolution of the object. Instead of creating a factory for the type and injecting the factory into your class, then using it to create the type you want you can use the .NET standard type Func<t> (C#) or Func(Of T) (Visual Basic) with the Resolve method. This returns a delegate that, when invoked, calls into the container and returns an instance of the specified type (in this case, T).<p>\n<p>You can even create a delegate in this way without creating a registration or mapping for the specified type in the container if you wish. Because the resolve action only takes place when you invoke the delegate, subsequent registrations added to the container are available when the target object is resolved. This means that you can manipulate the registrations and mappings in the container at any point before you resolve the target object (although you can obviously register the type before you create the delegate if you prefer).</p>\n<p>For example, you can create a delegate for a component named MyClass, and then register a mapping for it and perform deferred resolution when required using the following code.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-cs\">// Create a Unity container\nIUnityContainer myContainer = new UnityContainer();\n\n// Create a delegate for the IMyClass interface type\nvar resolver = myContainer.Resolve&lt;Func&lt;IMyClass&gt;&gt;();\n\n// ... other code here...\n\n// Register a mapping for the IMyClass interface to the MyClass type\nmyContainer.RegisterType&lt;IMyClass, MyClass&gt;();\n\n// Resolve the mapped target object\nIMyClass myClassInstance = resolver();\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can use this approach when you resolve the type using the Resolve method, or you can specify the delegate when you configure constructor, property setter, or method call injection. You can also use named (non-default) registrations by including the registration name in the call to the Resolve method and the RegisterType method, just as you would when using these methods for non-deferred resolution.</p>\n<p>In addition, you can use this feature to perform deferred resolution of multiple named registrations, as an alternative to using the ResolveAll method. For example, if you have multiple named registrations for the IMyClass interface to suitable concrete types, you can obtain a collection of the resolved types. The following code illustrates this.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-cs\">// Create a Unity container\nIUnityContainer myContainer = new UnityContainer();\n\n// Create an IEnumerable resolver for the IMyClass interface type\nvar resolver = myContainer.Resolve&lt;Func&lt;IEnumerable&lt;IMyClass&gt;&gt;&gt;();\n\n// ... other code here...\n\n// Register mappings for the IMyClass interface to appropriate concrete types\nmyContainer.RegisterType&lt;IMyClass, FirstClass&gt;(&quot;First&quot;);\nmyContainer.RegisterType&lt;IMyClass, SecondClass&gt;(&quot;Second&quot;);\nmyContainer.RegisterType&lt;IMyClass, ThidClass&gt;(&quot;Third&quot;);\n\n// Resolve a collection of the mapped target objects\nIEnumerable&lt;IMyClass&gt; myClassInstances = resolver();\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can also use the deferred resolver to resolve instance registrations. For example, the following code shows how you can resolve an IEnumerable collection of string values.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-cs\">// Create a Unity container\nIUnityContainer myContainer = new UnityContainer();\n\n// Create an IEnumerable resolver for string instance registrations\nvar resolver = myContainer.Resolve&lt;Func&lt;IEnumerable&lt;string&gt;&gt;&gt;();\n\n// ... other code here...\n\n// Register mappings for the IMyClass interface to appropriate concrete types\nmyContainer.RegisterInstance(&quot;one&quot;, &quot;FirstString&quot;);\nmyContainer.RegisterInstance(&quot;two&quot;, &quot;SecondString&quot;);\nmyContainer.RegisterInstance(&quot;three&quot;, &quot;ThirdString&quot;);\n\n// Resolve a collection of the strings\nIEnumerable&lt;string&gt; myStringInstances = resolver();\n</code></pre>\n</t>","content_git_url":"https://github.com/unitycontainer/documentation/blob/develop/tutorials/Composition/Generics/deferred.md","depot_name":".","document_id":"a1f92544-a7e3-3af7-c90f-d602719ebcfa","document_version_independent_id":"ec0143ad-09ff-c2bb-f179-d04c151dfa62","gitcommit":"https://github.com/unitycontainer/documentation/blob/704b5031aaedb4ba2af139c76a605c3c9b409600/tutorials/Composition/Generics/deferred.md","is_dynamic_rendering":true,"locale":"en-us","original_content_git_url":"https://github.com/unitycontainer/documentation/blob/develop/tutorials/Composition/Generics/deferred.md","original_content_git_url_template":"{repo}/blob/{branch}/tutorials/Composition/Generics/deferred.md","rawTitle":"<h1 id=\"deferring-the-resolution-of-objects\">Deferring the Resolution of Objects</h1>","search.ms_docsetname":"","search.ms_product":"","search.ms_sitename":"Docs","site_name":"Docs","title":"Deferred Resolution","uid":"Tutorial.Deferred","updated_at":"2019-04-30 12:00 AM","wordCount":520},{"url":"/tutorials/composition/generics/generics/","path":"tutorials/composition/generics/generics/index.html","source_path":"tutorials/Composition/Generics/generics.md","locale":"en-us","canonical_url":"https:///en-us/tutorials/composition/generics/generics/","conceptual":"\n<p>You resolve generic types in much the same way as you resolve non-generic types.

to Implementation mapping is done during the service registration.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-service-itself\">The Service Itself</h2>\n<p>The simplest type of registration is when service is registered by its own type.

Consider the following:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-cs\">public class Foo : IFoo1, IFoo2\n{\n    public Foo()\n    {\n    }\n\n    public Foo(object _)\n    {\n    }\n}\n\ncontainer.RegisterInstance&lt;IFoo&gt;(new Foo(), InstanceLifetime.Singleton);\n\ncontainer.RegisterType&lt;IFoo1, Foo&gt;();\n</code></pre>\n<p>The container has a registration for type <code>Foo</code>.

The following examples show the use of the overloads of the RegisterType and Resolve methods that accept object type names as the registration identifier.</p>\n<p>The following code registers a mapping for an object named MyBaseService and specifies that the container should return an instance of the CustomerService class (which inherits from the MyBaseService class). In this case, the type MyBaseService identifies the registration. Code that requests an instance of the type MyBaseService receives an instance of the CustomerService class.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-cs\">IUnityContainer myContainer = new UnityContainer();\nmyContainer.RegisterType&lt;MyBaseService, CustomerService&gt;();\n\nMyBaseService myServiceInstance = myContainer.Resolve&lt;MyBaseService&gt;();\n</code></pre>\n<p>Alternatively, you can use the non-generic overloads of the methods.

Then, to retrieve an object of the appropriate type, you specify the name and the registered type. Following examples demonstrate the technique:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-cs\">IUnityContainer container = new UnityContainer();\ncontainer.RegisterType&lt;IService, CustomerService&gt;();\ncontainer.RegisterType&lt;IService, CompanyService&gt;(&quot;name&quot;);\ncontainer.RegisterType&lt;IService, ExternalService&gt;(&quot;other name&quot;);\n\nvar instance = container.Resolve&lt;IService&gt;(&quot;name&quot;);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Alternatively, you can use the non-generic overloads of the methods. The following code achieves the same result.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-cs\">IUnityContainer container = new UnityContainer();\ncontainer.RegisterType&lt;IService, EmailService&gt;();\ncontainer.RegisterType&lt;IService, LDAPService&gt;(&quot;name&quot;);\ncontainer.RegisterType&lt;IService, CustomerService&gt;(&quot;other name&quot;);\n\nvar instance = (IService)container.Resolve(typeof(IMyService), &quot;other name&quot;);\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"note\">Note</h3>\n<p>If the target class or object specifies any dependencies of its own, using constructor, property, or method call injection attributes, the instance returned will have these dependent objects injected automatically.</p>\n<p>By default, the RegisterType method registers a type with a transient lifetime, which means that the container will not hold onto a reference to the objects it creates when you call the Resolve method. Each time you call one of these methods, the container generates a new instance of the specified or mapped type. However, you can use lifetime managers to control the creation, lifetime, and disposal of objects if required.</p>\n","content_git_url":"https://github.com/unitycontainer/documentation/blob/develop/tutorials/Composition/Resolution/type.md","depot_name":".","document_id":"828ddeb7-d1d0-42ca-3b7b-92e045095af2","document_version_independent_id":"00b7411d-8720-a67b-d3ce-17be06f6dca6","gitcommit":"https://github.com/unitycontainer/documentation/blob/704b5031aaedb4ba2af139c76a605c3c9b409600/tutorials/Composition/Resolution/type.md","is_dynamic_rendering":true,"locale":"en-us","original_content_git_url":"https://github.com/unitycontainer/documentation/blob/develop/tutorials/Composition/Resolution/type.md","original_content_git_url_template":"{repo}/blob/{branch}/tutorials/Composition/Resolution/type.md","rawTitle":"<h1 id=\"resolving-an-object-by-type\">Resolving an Object by Type</h1>","search.ms_docsetname":"","search.ms_product":"","search.ms_sitename":"Docs","site_name":"Docs","title":"Resolution By Type","uid":"Tutorial.Resolution.Type","updated_at":"2019-04-30 12:00 AM","wordCount":750},{"url":"/tutorials/composition/selection/constructor/","path":"tutorials/composition/selection/constructor/index.html","source_path":"tutorials/Composition/Selection/constructor.md","locale":"en-us","canonical_url":"https:///en-us/tutorials/composition/selection/constructor/","conceptual":"\n<p>Proper selection of the constructor used for type instantiation is one of the most important aspects of the container operation.

This technique is used by the Unity container to select a constructor and to satisfy any constructor dependencies defined in parameters of the constructor if no <a href=\"../../../annotation/annotation/\" data-linktype=\"relative-path\">Annotation</a> or <a href=\"../../../registration/registration/\" data-linktype=\"relative-path\">Registration</a> exists.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"automatic-constructor-selection\">Automatic Constructor Selection</h2>\n<p>Automatic constructor selection is performed if no other information is available on how to create a <a href=\"xref:System.Type\" data-linktype=\"external\">Type</a>. Unity uses dynamic, real time algorithm to discover and select a constructor.</p>\n<p>The Unity container will try to execute the most complex constructor it can provide with appropriate dependencies. In other words, if the container can resolve and/or inject all parameters of the constructor, it will be selected.</p>\n<h3 id=\"creating-build-pipeline\">Creating Build Pipeline</h3>\n<p>Selection process takes place during the first resolution of a <a href=\"xref:System.Type\" data-linktype=\"external\">Type</a> contract. Unity container employs lazy resolution strategy. It will defer pipeline creation until the contract (<a href=\"../../../registration/metadata/\" data-linktype=\"relative-path\">RegistrationType and Name</a>) is requested.</p>\n<p>The lazy approach allows registrations to proceed at random order and do not require dependencies to be registered before dependents. As long as all of these are available at the time of resolution Unity does not care in what order they were registered.</p>\n<h3 id=\"constructor-selection-steps\">Constructor Selection Steps</h3>\n<p>One of the first steps, when creating a pipeline, is a constructor selection.

There are just a few simple rules to follow when dealing with container hierarchies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Types registered in predecessor containers always available in descendant containers. This is a very simple concept, each registration is like a public virtual declaration in cs types. Every descendant inherits it and can use at will.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Types registered in descendant containers override the same registration of predecessors. Following the same analogy with public virtual declarations, each override registration installs its own declaration and hides the one in predecessor containers.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"using-container-hierarchies\">Using Container Hierarchies</h2>\n<p>Unity supports nested containers, allowing you to build container hierarchies. Nesting containers enables you to control the scope and lifetime of singleton objects, and register different mappings for specific types. This topic contains the following sections that describe how you can create container hierarchies and use them in your applications:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Constructing and Disposing Unity Containers</li>\n<li>Controlling Object Scope and Lifetime</li>\n<li>Overriding registrations</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"constructing-and-disposing-unity-containers\">Constructing and Disposing Unity Containers</h3>\n<p>The following methods enable you to create a new default UnityContainer, create a child container that has a specified UnityContainer as its parent, and dispose an existing container.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align: left;\">Method</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\"><code>new UnityContainer()</code></td>\n<td>Creates a root UnityContainer. Returns a reference to the new container.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\"><code>CreateChildContainer()</code></td>\n<td>Creates a new nested UnityContainer as a child of the current container. The current container first applies its own settings, and then it checks the parent for additional settings. Returns a reference to the new container.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\"><code>Dispose()</code></td>\n<td>Disposes this container instance and any child containers. Also disposes any registered object instances whose lifetimes are managed by the container.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3 id=\"controlling-object-scope-and-lifetime\">Controlling Object Scope and Lifetime</h3>\n<p>When the container creates singleton objects, it manages the lifetime of these singletons. They remain in scope until you (or the garbage collector) dispose the container. At this point, it disposes the registered singleton instances it contains. In addition, if you dispose the parent container in a nested container hierarchy, it automatically disposes all child containers and the registered singletons they contain.</p>\n<p>Therefore, if you require two separate sets of such objects that must have different lifetimes, you can use hierarchical containers to store and manage each set. Register instances that you want to be able to dispose separately in one or more child containers that you can dispose without disposing the parent container.</p>\n<p>The following code demonstrates the use of a child container to manage the lifetime of specific singleton instances while maintaining the singleton instances in the parent container.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-cs\">\n// Create parent container\nIUnityContainer parentCtr = new UnityContainer();\n\n// Register type in parent container\nparentCtr.RegisterType&lt;MyParentObject&gt;(TypeLifetime.PerContainer);\n\n// Create nested child container in parent container\nIUnityContainer childCtr = parentCtr.CreateChildContainer();\n\n// Register type in child container\nchildCtr.RegisterType&lt;MyChildObject&gt;(TypeLifetime.PerContainer);\n\n// Create instance of type stored in parent container\nMyParentObject parentObj = parentCtr.Resolve&lt;MyParentObject&gt;();\n\n// Create instance of type stored in child container\nMyChildObject childObj = childCtr.Resolve&lt;MyChildObject&gt;();\n\n// ... can use both generated objects here ...\n\n// Dispose child container\nchildCtr.Dispose();\n\n// ... can use only object in parent container here ...\n\n// Dispose parent container\nparentCtr.Dispose();\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"overriding-registrations\">Overriding registrations</h3>\n<p>You can use nested containers when you have slightly different dependency injection requirements for specific objects but want to provide a fallback facility for objects that implement a specific interface or are of a specific type. For example, you may have a general requirement for objects that implement the IMyObject interface to map to the type MyStandardObject. However, in specific parts of the application code, you may want the IMyObject interface to map to the type MySpecialObject.</p>\n<p>In this case, you can register the general mapping in the parent container and register the specific case in a child container. Then, when you want to obtain an instance of the object, you call the Resolve method on the appropriate container. If you call the method on the child container, it returns an object of type MySpecialObject. If you call the method on the parent container, it returns an object of type MyStandardObject.</p>\n<p>However, the advantage with nested containers is that, if the child container cannot locate a mapping for the requested interface or type, it passes the request to its parent container and onward through the hierarchy until it reaches the root or base container. Therefore, for objects not mapped in the child container, the mapping in the parent container (or in an ancestor container where there are more than two levels in the hierarchy) defines the object type returned.</p>\n<p>The following code shows how you can implement the preceding scenario.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-cs\">// Create parent container\nIUnityContainer parentCtr = new UnityContainer();\n\n// Register two mappings for types in parent container\nparentCtr.RegisterType&lt;IMyObject, MyStandardObject&gt;();\nparentCtr.RegisterType&lt;IMyOtherObject, MyOtherObject&gt;();\n\n// Create nested child container in parent container\nIUnityContainer childCtr = parentCtr.CreateChildContainer();\n\n// Register mapping for specific type in child container\nchildCtr.RegisterType&lt;IMyObject, MySpecialObject&gt;();\n\n// Now retrieve instances of the mapped objects using the child container.\n// Using the interface as the type for the returned objects means that it\n// does not matter which container returns the actual object.\n\n// This code returns an object of type MySpecialObject using the mapping\n// registered in the child container:\nIMyObject specialObject = childCtr.Resolve&lt;IMyObject&gt;();\n\n// This code returns an object of type MyOtherObject using the mapping\n// registered in the parent container because there is no mapping in \n// the child container for this type:\nIMyOtherObject otherObject = childCtr.Resolve&lt;IMyOtherObject&gt;();\n\n// Now retrieve instance of the standard object using the parent container.\n// This code returns an object of type MyStandardObject using the mapping\n// registered in the parent container:\nIMyObject standardObject = parentCtr.Resolve&lt;IMyObject&gt;();\n\n// Dispose parent container and child container\nparentCtr.Dispose();\n</code></pre>\n","content_git_url":"https://github.com/unitycontainer/documentation/blob/develop/tutorials/hierarchies.md","depot_name":".","document_id":"f2ce8356-f147-18ea-608e-d435aba30a24","document_version_independent_id":"3059ba46-3fde-dc5c-c040-4e7e672e2330","gitcommit":"https://github.com/unitycontainer/documentation/blob/8a5e5548aca3d3a178c32f6a6b4cc98de7f982a0/tutorials/hierarchies.md","is_dynamic_rendering":true,"locale":"en-us","original_content_git_url":"https://github.com/unitycontainer/documentation/blob/develop/tutorials/hierarchies.md","original_content_git_url_template":"{repo}/blob/{branch}/tutorials/hierarchies.md","rawTitle":"<h1 id=\"container-hierarchies\">Container Hierarchies</h1>","search.ms_docsetname":"","search.ms_product":"","search.ms_sitename":"Docs","site_name":"Docs","title":"Container Hierarchy","uid":"Tutorial.Container.Hierarchy","updated_at":"2019-03-16 08:42 PM","wordCount":935},{"url":"/tutorials/lifetime/container/","path":"tutorials/lifetime/container/index.html","source_path":"tutorials/lifetime/container.md","locale":"en-us","canonical_url":"https:///en-us/tutorials/lifetime/container/","conceptual":"\n<p>Per Container lifetime allows a registration of an existing or resolved object as a scoped singleton in the container it was created or registered.

If you are satisfied with annotated selections, appropriate constructor and all other members are annotated, and you do not require lifetime management for created instances, the <a href=\"xref:System.Type\" data-linktype=\"external\">Type</a> should not be registered.</p>\n<p>You should only register types if at least one of the following is true:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Contract/Registration requires a Name</li>\n<li>Require a mapping between service and implementation types</li>\n<li>Require lifetime policy other than transient</li>\n<li>Need to override injection annotated with attribute(s)</li>\n<li>Nondefault constructor should be selected</li>\n<li>Properties or fields should be injected</li>\n<li>Method(s) should be called during initialization</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"creating-registration-contracts\">Creating Registration Contracts</h2>\n<p>Simplest form of a contract is a registration without a Name ( the Name is <code>null</code> ). This type of registration is called <code>default</code> and in some cases is used as a prototype during resolution of Generic types (hence name <code>default</code>).</p>\n<p>A contract could have a Name. The Name could be any arbitrary string of one or more characters. The simple named contract could be registered like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-cs\">container.RegisterType&lt;Service&gt;(&quot;Contract Name&quot;);\n</code></pre>\n<div class=\"NOTE\">\n<h5>NOTE</h5>\n<p>It is not recommended to use empty strings as names.</p>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"creating-type-mapping\">Creating Type Mapping</h2>\n<p>A mapping instructs Unity on how to satisfy the contract and what implementation <a href=\"xref:System.Type\" data-linktype=\"external\">Type</a> should be used to create an object. For example is you want to associate an interface <code>IService</code> with implementation <code>Service</code> you would register it like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-cs\">container.RegisterType&lt;IService, Service&gt;();\n</code></pre>\n<p>Or you could register multiple implementations for the same service:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-cs\">container.RegisterType&lt;IService, MailService&gt;(&quot;Email&quot;);\ncontainer.RegisterType&lt;IService, WebService&gt;(&quot;WebMail&quot;);\ncontainer.RegisterType&lt;IService, SecureService&gt;(&quot;Encrypted&quot;);\n</code></pre>\n<p>For more information see &lt;xref:Tutorial.Registration.Mapping&gt;</p>\n<h2 id=\"lifetime-management\">Lifetime Management</h2>\n<p>Unity provides wide variety of lifetime managers <a href=\"xref:Unity.TypeLifetime\" data-linktype=\"external\">compatible</a> with type registrations. Each of these managers provide unique algorithm for instance management.</p>\n<p>In example above services are created on each request. In most cases it is desireable to create services only once. To create singleton services appropriate lifetime managers must be added to the registration:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-cs\">container.RegisterType&lt;IService, MailService&gt;(&quot;Email&quot;, TypeLifetime.Singleton);\ncontainer.RegisterType&lt;IService, WebService&gt;(&quot;WebMail&quot;, TypeLifetime.Singleton);\ncontainer.RegisterType&lt;IService, SecureService&gt;(&quot;Encrypted&quot;, TypeLifetime.Singleton);\n</code></pre>\n<p>For more information about lifetime management see <a href=\"../../../lifetime/lifetime/\" data-linktype=\"relative-path\">Lifetime Management</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"creation-pipeline\">Creation Pipeline</h2>\n<p>Unity instantiates an objects by creating a resolver pipeline and executing it with passed in injection values. Each pipeline consists of a several steps with each step performing part of the initialization.</p>\n<p>How the pipeline is assembled and what values are injected is controlled by collection of <a href=\"xref:Unity.Injection.InjectionMember\" data-linktype=\"external\">Injection Member</a> objects passed to registration method. The normal steps of the object creation process are:</p>\n<h2 id=\"injection-instructions\">Injection Instructions</h2>\n<p>During the registration you could Configure the container to select certain constructor, initialize properties and fields, call methods, and inject values and instructions for dependencies. All this is done by passing appropriate <a href=\"xref:Unity.Injection\" data-linktype=\"external\">Injection Members</a> to the registration.
